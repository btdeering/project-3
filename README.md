# Project-3: COVID-19 United States Metrics

We created a visualization of covid-19's effect on the United States. The variables go as followed confirmed cases, deaths, 
and the case fatality ratio (Deaths/ Confirmed cases). To clarify the results we assigned each state a region 
better to show covid-19's impact on the United States. The regions go as follows Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, Rocky Mountains, and Pacific. The Data was obtained from [John Hopkins University])https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/01-01-2021.csv). We chose 01/01/2021, 01/01/2022, and 01/01/2023. The javascript will provide better clarification of our work.

For web application:
- Covid_data.js in the Covid_data folder is the main javascript file to run the application.
- style.css in the Covid_data folder is the main CSS file.
- index.html file is the main file to run.

Steps to run the HTML web application:

- Clone the repository to the local folder.
- Go to your terminal and find the location where the index.html file is. 
- type: python -m http.server (to run the local server)
- From your local folder open the "index.html" file.
- Once the HTML browser opens clear the browser and type: localhost:8000  ( to run the web application)

Analysis
-The analysis of COVID-19 impact across different regions reveals significant variations in the increase of confirmed cases, deaths, and changes in the case fatality ratio. 
-The Southwest region experienced a substantial surge in cases, while the Southeast region faced higher mortality rates.
-The Southeast region also demonstrated the most significant improvement in managing severe cases. These findings underscore the importance of region-specific strategies to control the spread, reduce mortality rates, and effectively address the impact of COVID-19 on public health.
-The data highlights the importance of analyzing regional variations in COVID-19 impact. It emphasizes the need for tailored and targeted interventions, considering the specific challenges and patterns of infection, mortality, and case fatality ratio within each region. This analysis can guide policymakers and healthcare authorities in implementing region-specific measures to effectively control the spread of the virus and minimize the impact on public health.
